Research Question: Is it easier or harder to hide adversarial prompts in longer documents?

Key Finding from Literature:
The "Lost in the Middle" phenomenon suggests adversarial prompts placed in middle
positions of long documents may be LESS effective due to attention dilution.
However, no prior work has systematically tested document LENGTH variation.

Recommended Next Steps:
1. Generate synthetic long documents at varying lengths
2. Embed attack payloads at different positions
3. Measure attack success rate across length × position matrix
4. Compare results to baseline (no document padding)
