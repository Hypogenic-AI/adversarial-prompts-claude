## Resource Gathering Complete

I have completed the research resource gathering phase for the project: **"Is it easier or harder to hide adversarial prompts in longer documents?"**

### Summary of Deliverables

| Resource Type | Count | Location |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| **Papers** | 11 PDFs | `papers/` |
| **Datasets** | 3 (140K+ samples total) | `datasets/` |
| **Code Repositories** | 5 | `code/` |

### Key Papers Downloaded

1. **Indirect Prompt Injection** (Greshake et al.) - Foundational IPI paper
2. **BIPIA Benchmark** (Yi et al.) - First benchmark testing position effects
3. **Lost in the Middle** (Liu et al.) - Critical insight on attention patterns
4. **TensorTrust** - 126K human-generated attacks
5. **SaTML CTF Dataset** - 137K attack chats
6. + 6 more supporting papers

### Datasets Ready

- **prompt-injections** (deepset): 662 labeled injection examples
- **ctf-satml24** (ETH Zurich): 137K attack chats + 44 defenses
- **mrcr** (OpenAI): 2,400 long-context coreference samples

### Code Repositories Cloned

- **BIPIA** - Position-based testing framework
- **Needle-in-Haystack** - Long-context testing harness
- **Open-Prompt-Injection** - Attack/defense toolkit
- **Universal-Prompt-Injection** - Automated attack generation
- **CTF Platform** - Competition infrastructure

### Key Insight from Literature

The **"Lost in the Middle"** phenomenon suggests that LLMs attend less to content in the middle of long documents. This could mean:
- Adversarial prompts in the **middle** may be less effective (attention dilution)
- Adversarial prompts at the **start/end** may be more effective (primacy/recency bias)
- **No prior work has systematically varied document LENGTH** - this is the research gap
